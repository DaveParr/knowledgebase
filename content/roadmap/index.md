SatRdays is a new(ish) conference initiative so we're working on experimenting and growing the events.

During 2018-2019 we will be aiming to throw one event per quarter per region (North America / Europe / Rest of World) with a view to understanding demand from attendees and supply from speakers and sponsors.
