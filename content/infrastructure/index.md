## Working together
We use Slack and Github as our primary tools to work as a group. Join us on the #satrdays-chat channel on the [R User Groups Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rusergroups/shared_invite/enQtMjEyNDA3MzcyMjczLTE3NWEzNjQ3MjZiMWM0OGE2ZWFiZDliNTY4NTJjYWY1NGNjMmNlNDUzNzkzOTZmMDBjYjRiZjFhNjk4MDY0ZGY) to chat.

## Websites
Most of our websites are [Hugo](//gohugo.io) or [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com) and are deployed on [Netlify](//netlify.com).

## Marketing
Most event organisers use [Mailchimp](//mailchimp.com) to build a mailing list of attendees and communicate with them.
