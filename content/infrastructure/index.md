## Working together
We use Slack and Github as our primary tools to work as a group. Join us on the #satrdays-chat channel on the [R User Groups Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rusergroups/shared_invite/enQtMjEyNDA3MzcyMjczLTE3NWEzNjQ3MjZiMWM0OGE2ZWFiZDliNTY4NTJjYWY1NGNjMmNlNDUzNzkzOTZmMDBjYjRiZjFhNjk4MDY0ZGY) to chat.

## Websites
We have built a set of partials for [Hugo](//gohugo.io) which are designed as a quick start solution for each events individual website. they are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/satRdays/satRday_site_template) along with guidance on their use.

Most of our websites are [Hugo](//gohugo.io) or [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com) and are deployed on [Netlify](//netlify.com).

## Ticketing
[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/), [Tito](https://www.eventbrite.com/) and [Ticket Tailor](https://www.eventbrite.com/) have all been used for events in the past.

## Marketing
Most event organisers use [Mailchimp](//mailchimp.com) to build a mailing list of attendees and communicate with them. 

## Call for Papers
We have an ongoing discount with [sessionize.com](//sessionize.com) and will support the use of this with the remaining R Consortium funds for folks to use for their CFPs.
