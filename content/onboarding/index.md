Here's the list of things we need to do when someone starts a satRday event:

1. Make sure the [events calendar](https://github.com/satRdays/eventscalendar) is correctly filled out
1. Make sure the leader understands the important requirements about a satRday
1. Recommend a past organiser they can lean on for advice, above and beyond the central team who will also be available
1. Make a channel on the R UG ORganiser slack like satrdays-[city] and invite the leader (this might be optional if folks would like to work purely within the github team interface)
1. Add the lead organiser on github to the [satrdays org](https://github.com/orgs/satRdays/people)
1. Make a github team like [city][yyyy] and add the lead organier in the maintainer role. This will allow them to add other team members in future.
1. Add a copy of the website template as a new repo with name [city][yyyy] 
1. Give the team admin permissions over this repo
1. Setup a netlify deployment of the site and use a custom domain of the format  [city][yyyy].satrdays.org
