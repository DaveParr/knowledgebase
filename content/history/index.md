## R Consortium
satRdays was originally founded after requesting support the [R Consortium](//www.r-consortium.org).

Steph Locke and Gergely Daroczig were the key signatories to a [proposal for funding](//github.com/satRdays/RSaturday-proposal/blob/master/out/satRdays-proposal.pdf) where the events were initially outlined.
